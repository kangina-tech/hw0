This assignment is focused on going through basic Java syntax concepts. We focus on:
* Basic Conditionals
* If Statements
* While Loops
* Doubles and Strings
* Methods
* Arrays
* For Loops
* Break and Continue
* Enhanced For Loop

## Exercises
To hone in on the concepts, there is focus on a couple of exercises.
* **Drawing a Triangle** - The goal is to use loops as well as practice the Java syntax in a small algorithm.

* **Drawing a Spaced Trangle** - To understand the use of Methods, enhance the use of loops and get more comfortable with creating short and effective algorithms.

* **Making Arrays** - Learn new Methods as well as the concept of arrays as they partain to the structure of Java.

* **windowPosSum** - Combines all the learnt concepts through the class down to a new Method that is very different from the ones I got accustomed to.
